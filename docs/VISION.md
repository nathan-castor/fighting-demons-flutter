# Fighting Demons — Vision Document

## The Elevator Pitch

**Fighting Demons** transforms daily fitness and meditation into an epic spiritual battle. You're bonded with a Spirit Guide who starts as a faint ember and evolves into a transcendent being as you complete challenges. The demons are real — they feed on your inaction, comfort, and sleep. Fight back.

## Core Philosophy

### Why It Works
1. **Emotional Stakes** — Your Spirit Guide is a relationship, not a stat. When you fail, they fade. When you succeed, they grow. That hits different than a streak counter.

2. **Fast Early Wins** — First evolution happens on Day 2 (44 points). Hook them before habit fatigue sets in.

3. **Real Stakes** — Death/rebirth mechanic means failure has consequences, but isn't permanent. You can always start over, but you lose progress.

4. **Wisdom Integration** — Not just gamification. Real teachings from Stoicism, Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Desert Fathers. Makes the user feel like they're learning something ancient and true.

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Movement (Dawn Face-Off)
- Walk/run 1 mile every morning
- Represents: Physical discipline, breaking inertia
- "Each mile walked is a prayer"

### 2. Strength (Noon Face-Off)
- Pushups/pullups to failure
- Represents: Testing limits, facing resistance
- "Every rep is an act of defiance"

### 3. Stillness (All Face-Offs)
- 10 minutes meditation after each activity
- Represents: Mental fortress, watching thoughts
- "The untrained mind is an open gate"

## Target User

**Primary:** Men 25-45 who:
- Feel stuck, sedentary, or spiritually empty
- Have tried fitness apps but found them soulless
- Are interested in philosophy/spirituality but not religious
